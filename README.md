# Hospital Readmissions Project

## Project Overview 

This hypothetical project was commissioned by a hospital board seeking to reduce costs associated with patient readmissions. Using machine learning methods, I plan to find ways to save money. This file will be used to show each step in the project, instructions to run any code, and disclosure statements.

## Step 1: Find Resources
Two resources for background information:

## Step 2: Dataset Assessment
The data comes from https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3, a government website relating to medicare and medicaid services. The dataset is read in the file step_3_assessment.py. We can see that the data includes 18510 rows of data, along with 12 variable columns. Other assessments can be found in code.
